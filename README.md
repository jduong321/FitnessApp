# FitnessApp

Small personal project that incorporates my passion for working out. 

Fitness applications did not have everything I wanted. Things such as a HIIT timer or an average calorie burn per exercise/workout. Other things such as a calorie calculator or a workout planner that many other applications have are a core part of a fitness app that I plan to implement. 

Ideas:

        HIIT timer - a timer that would have a "intense" and "rest" period rather than having to always interact with the timer.
        
        Calorie calculator - input foods and their calorie to keep track of how much calories was ate.
                - also to include macronutrients such as fat and carbs to keep track of.

        Workout planner - keeps track of what exercise should be done and on average how much calories it burns.
        
        Progression tracker - Any way to keep track of progress whether it is by lift amount or physical appearance.
