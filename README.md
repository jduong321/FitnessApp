# FitnessApp

Small personal project that incorporates my passion for working out. 

Some fitness apps did not have what I wanted so I tried my best
to slowly take what they had that I liked and implement my own ideas.

Ideas:

        HIIT timer - a timer that would have a "intense" and "rest" period rather than having to always interact with the timer.
        
        Calorie calculator - input foods and their calorie to keep track of how much calories was ate.

        Workout planner - keeps track of what exercise should be done and on average how much calories it burns.
        
        Progression tracker - Any way to keep track of progress whether it is by lift amount or physical appearance.
